# Fake-Beef-Detection-Using-Lightweight-Convolutional-Neural-Networks


# Overview

This project provides a method for automatically detecting fake beef by image analysis. High-quality classification models could have a major impact on ensuring food quality, supporting supply chain management in the meat industry, and preventing fraudulent commercial practices. Because low-quality meat is cheaper and more widely available than beef, it is common to use them as a substitute for fake beef. The problem is due to the differences in meat appearance, texture, mutilation, and color of cuts, as well as similarities between real beef and fake beef. These characteristics require a robust method to distinguish subtle characteristics to obtain reliable results. This paper combines the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks to detect a true classification of beef and fake beef. This model targets mobile applications and is suitable for the practical deployment of various environments.This project aims to detect fake beef using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify real beef and commonly used substitutes, such as pork and buffalo meat. This work was accepted at ICICT 2025.
