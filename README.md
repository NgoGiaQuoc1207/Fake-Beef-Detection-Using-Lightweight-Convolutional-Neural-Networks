# Fake-Beef-Detection-Using-Lightweight-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Overview
This project aims to detect fake beef using a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify real beef and commonly used substitutes, such as pork and buffalo meat. This work was accepted at ICICT 2025.

Supports real-time prediction.

Dataset includes images from Kaggle, iStock, and real-world captures.

Preprocessing with HSV and edge detection for better feature extraction.

Achieves over 90% accuracy on the test set.

Designed for deployment via API.
